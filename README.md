# Acoustic Calibrator
**A real-time embedded audio system that filters a raw audio signal to counteract the unique acoustic frequency characteristics of a room. Implemented in C using TI's SYS/BIOS RTOS for the TMS320F28027 Piccolo LaunchPad. Developed by John Matson and Alexander Mueller in fall 2020 for BCIT's ELEX 7820, taught by David Romalo.**
